# Variables

    1. String Concatenation

    2. Separate string into Arguments.

    3. Fstrings

    4. Data types: Integer, Float, String, Boolean

        Note: Boolean must not be in quotes

    # Tips and Tricks:-
        - multiple assignment

---------------------------------------

# Type Casting

    - The process of converting a value of one data type to another
    - (string, integer, float, boolean)
    - Explicit vs Implicit

    1. Type function

    2. Explicit Cast
        - manually converting data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), and str()

        Note: Boolean 0 is only false, and -3 -2 -1 1 2 3... in the boolean values are considered to be true.

    3. Implicit Cast
        - a variables data type can be converted if certain operations are performed in it.

# User Input

    - use of input function to store input in a variable

            Example:-
                name = input("Enter your name: ")
                print(f" Hello {name}")

                Note: Inputs are always on STRING data type and one must do typecasting.

    - Exercises:

            1. Mad libs Game

                - a word game where one player asks others to fill in blanks in a story with words

                Code:

                    adjective1 = input("Enter an adjective: ")
                    noun = input("Enter a noun: ")
                    adjective2 = input("Enter an adjective: ")
                    verb = input("Enter an verb: ")
                    adjective3 = input("Enter an adjective: ")

                    print(f"Today I went to a {adjective1} zoo.")
                    print(f"In a exhibit, I saw {noun}")
                    print(f"{noun} was {adjective2} and {verb}ing ")
                    print(f"I was {adjective3}")


            2. Area of a Rectangle

                Code:

                    length = float(input("Length: "))
                    width = float(input("Width: "))
                    height = float(input("Height: "))

                    volume = length * width * height

                    print(f"The volume is: {volume}cm^3")


             3. Shopping Cart

                Code:

                item = input("What item would you like to buy?: ")
                price = float(input("What is the price?: "))
                quantity = int(input("How many would you like?: "))

                total = price * quantity

                print(f"You have bought {quantity} x {item}/s")
                print(f"Your total is: ${round(total, 2)}")

                    Note: round() is used to round off upto 2 decimal places.
